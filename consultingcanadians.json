The engagement process is designed to meet Treasury Board standards for regulatory development and will include pre-engagement on the regulatory proposal to obtain early feedback and direct engagement on the regulations after being published in the Canada Gazette, Part 1. Stakeholders include Indigenous groups, interested provinces and territories, federal departments, NGOs, fishing groups, and the renewable energy industry. Phase 1 of the ORER initiative engagement process occured in 2020. Information on Phase 1, including a summary of the comments received from stakeholders, can be found on the ORER webpage.\r\nPhase 2 of engagement, launched in December 2021, and consisted of pre-engagement on technical requirements for the regulations. As part of Phase 2, NRCan has posted a Technical Requirements Paper that outlines the proposed structure of the regulations. Stakeholders were invited to review the paper and to submit feedback. The comment period ran from December 7, 2021 – February 21, 2022. Part 3, the pre-publication of the ORER in Part 1 of the Canada Gazette for public comments, is expected to take place in 2024.",

        "description": "Public Safety Canada continues to develop a National Risk Profile (NRP) which employs scientific evidence and stakeholder input to create a forward-looking picture of risk and capabilities. The NRP aims to assist in decision-making to support resilience to disasters such as floods, wildfires, and earthquakes. This reflects the Minister of Emergency Preparedness’ mandate commitment to develop an NRP to inform decision-making and planning. \r\nDuring 2021-22, whole-of-society risk assessment sessions were held to better understand national risks and challenges with respect to floods, wildfires and earthquakes. The initial round of engagement  concluded in early 2022, with the second round of engagement with whole-of-society participants starting in Spring 2022. \r\nParticipants include experts from across all levels of government, academia, and the private sector, in order to produce a whole-of-society picture of disaster risks. Targeted sessions were also held to include diverse and distinctions-based Indigenous representation in an effort to incorporate traditional knowledge and perspectives with respect to risks facing Indigenous communities. The Department has established a contract to specifically engage with Indigenous representation throughout 2022. \r\nFindings and perspectives  were explored through corresponding whole-of-society capability assessments, which sought to identify capability gaps across Canada. Evidence from these sessions has been incorporated into the second report to Cabinet and first public report on the NRP, which was released during Emergency Preparedness Week in early May 2023. Further engagement with Provinces and Territories, National Indigenous Organizations and other stakeholders is planned in conjunction with the launch of the public report.\r\nNRP Round 2 activities and engagement began in late 2022, and will continue through Winter and Spring 2023. The focus of these engagement sessions in on heat events, hurricanes, and space weather hazards. Engagement for the risk assessments within Round 2 have been split into various groups for the purpose of targeting questions to expertise; these include internal federal hazard experts, internal/external impact experts, representatives of GBA+ communities, and Indigenous partners. Participants will be invited to provide feedback through a variety of touchpoints, including virtual information sessions, risk assessment surveys, and virtual discussions. Concurrently, capability assessments will take place across Spring 2022, engaging federal and provincial partners on the current state and desired state for each emergency management capability in the Canadian Core Capabilities List.",

A targeted consultation across the broader critical infrastructure (CI) community was conducted to support future initiative and approach development, which will strengthen the  resilience of Canada’s CI. This included an online consultation using the Bang The Table software platform that was open for a period of six weeks, from April 20-June 1, 2022 and available to CI stakeholders via both English and French versions of the consultation domain name letstalkcriticalinfrastructure.ca and Parlonsinfrastructuresessentielles.ca. Targeted engagement with various CI sector and stakeholder groups continues throughout the renewal process to inform the development of options and new approaches. The intended outcome is to develop a forward-facing national strategy and approach to CI resilience efforts in a rapidly changing threat and risk environment. This renewal project comes on the heels of an examination of the National Strategy for CI, which concluded that the current strategy and approach (established in 2009) does not reflect the evolving risk landscape.",

If you are affected by the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people and need immediate emotional assistance, please call 1-844-413-6649.\r\n\r\nCrown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) has partnered with Statistics Canada to initiate a consultative engagement process in response to Call for Justice 9.5.v (PDF), one of the 231 Calls for Justice outlined in the Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls: Reclaiming Power and Place. The input received as part of this consultative process will form the basis of recommendations leading to the development of national data standards for police services. The objective of this work is to improve the information police gather on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, 2SLGBTQQIA+ persons, vulnerable, marginalized, and racialized persons. Reliable and consistent information can play a role in helping to find missing persons and build prevention strategies. Data will allow for regular, continuous, and consistent statistical reporting and monitoring at national, provincial, and sub-provincial levels.\r\n\r\nIn the first phase of consultative engagement, the Canadian Centre for Justice and Community Safety Statistics (CCJCSS) and Stakeholder Relations and the Engagement Division (SRED) have organized virtual consultative engagement sessions with key federal partners and agencies, provincial-territorial focal points and ministries, and National Indigenous Organizations.\r\n\r\nHow to get involved\r\nStatistics Canada will continue to engage various organizations over the next 12 months through virtual group discussions and written submissions. Disclosure of personal experiences are not within the scope of this engagement.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to obtain more information on this engagement initiative or are interested in participating, please contact us by email at consultativeengagement-mobilisationconsultative@statcan.gc.ca.\r\n\r\nStatistics Canada is committed to respecting the privacy of participants.

This shared standard classification is available for use by the federal research granting agencies, Statistics Canada and any other organization or individual that find it useful to implement. The CRDC is aligned with international research and development classification standards.Statistics Canada, as custodian of the CRDC, and its close partner research funding agencies, have agreed to undertake minor revisions of the classification every year or two, and major revision every five years. In fact, all parties already agreed that the first CRDC 2020 version 1.0 will be revised within 2 years of its first release date, and on a five-year cycle after that, with the possibility of 'evergreening' for minor changes once a year to reflect the changes in the research fields.

        "description": "This consultation runs from May 20 to July 31, 2023.\r\nConsultation description\r\n• The Government of Canada is seeking the views of the Canadian public and interested stakeholders to help define priorities for developing the Canada-Africa Economic Cooperation Strategy (CA-ECS).\r\n• The CA-ECS will seek to enhance commercial and economic cooperation relations with African countries and aim to support Canada’s overall goal of increasing and diversifying trade, investment and innovation with African partners. \r\nPurpose of the consultation\r\n• The Government of Canada is working to develop the CA-ECS, which will contribute meaningfully to Canada’s overall economic, social and environmental priorities.  \r\n• The consultation process will help ensure the Strategy reflects and takes into account the perspectives of interested stakeholders. It will focus on:\r\n\r\n• Understanding Canadian private-sector perspectives on economic growth and business potential in Africa; \r\n• Identifying sectors and countries or regions that have the greatest potential for Canadian businesses; \r\n• Identifying any major obstacles to further trade, investment and innovation from both Canadian and African perspectives, and exploring potential solutions;\r\n• Informing the development of effective policy tools; and\r\n• Identifying research and innovation areas with potential for future Canadian and African cooperation.\r\nWho should participate?\r\nThis consultation is open to the public and everyone is invited to share their ideas.\r\nIn particular, we would like to invite input from groups traditionally under-represented in international trade and investment on the potential gender, environmental and social impacts of developing an economic cooperation strategy with Africa. \r\nWe would like to hear the views of the Canadian public and interested stakeholders including:\r\n• businesses, including micro-, small, medium and large-sized enterprises\r\n• Canadian private sector, investors and industry leads \r\n• industry associations\r\n• research, innovation and academic institutions \r\n• civil society organizations and non-governmental organizations\r\n• African diaspora communities in Canada \r\n• provincial, territorial and municipal governments\r\n• national, provincial, territorial and regional associations\r\n• students and youth\r\n• Indigenous groups\r\n• gender equality-seeking groups\r\nFor reasons of confidentiality and security, the submissions and names of contributors to this consultation process will not be released to the public by the Government of Canada.\r\nHow to participate?\r\n• Interested parties are encouraged to review the background information (below) and provide written comments by e-mail at AfricaCooperationAfrique@international.gc.ca before the consultation period closes on July 31, 2023.  \r\n• Please read the privacy notice statement carefully prior to sending a written submission. When providing your personal opinion(s), we ask that you refrain from including the personal/confidential information of other individuals or organizations.\r\nBackground\r\nAfrica is home to a wide variety of markets, from the advanced economy of South Africa, middle-income countries such as Botswana and Namibia, and coastal countries with strong developing economies characterized by investment-friendly business environments, such as Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, and Morocco. The growing workforce, rapid urbanization, ongoing improvements in governance, economic management, and stability of many countries underpin their positive economic trajectories. There are also a number of countries with challenging economic environments.\r\n\r\nThe African continent, which includes 20% of the earth’s surface, 60% of the world’s arable land, and 30% of the world’s mineral deposits, including the critical minerals needed in green and digital technologies and renewable energy, has vast economic potential and significant strategic importance. By 2050, Africa will have a population of 2.53 billion people and 1 in 4 people worldwide will be living in Sub-Saharan Africa: it is a growing market that will be home to the youngest population of any continent. African countries are, moreover, essential partners if the world is to achieve its biodiversity and climate mitigation and adaptation goals.  \r\n\r\nThe development of a Canada-Africa Economic Cooperation Strategy is timely, particularly as African countries work to implement the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Trading under the Agreement has started amongst a limited number of countries, and full implementation is expected by 2035. According to a World Bank report issued in 2020, by 2035 the AfCFTA will boost regional incomes by 7% or $450 billion. Once fully implemented, it will constitute a single market with free movement of goods, services and people, and a combined GDP of $3.4 trillion. \r\n\r\nRelated link: The African Continental Free Trade Area: Economic and Distributional Effects (PDF)\r\n\r\n Implications for Canada  \r\nFrom 2012 to 2022, merchandise exports to Africa have increased by approximately 43%, but still represent only 0.7% of Canada’s total in 2022. In 2021, known Canadian Direct Investment Abroad for Africa was $14.5 billion, while known Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Canada from Africa was $2.1 billion. Africa’s emerging and frontier markets, the anticipated growth in the continent’s economies and consumer markets, and the integrated, rules-based and transparent trade and investment environment that is expected to accompany implementation of the AfCFTA, present opportunities to significantly increase these figures.\r\n \r\nCanada’s Feminist Foreign Policy supports the advancement of human rights, gender equality, diversity and inclusion both as valuable goals in their own right and as essential conditions for durable peace and security, sustainable economic development, and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Canada’s Feminist International Assistance Policy, notably the Action Area on Growth that Works for Everyone, will continue to guide international assistance programming, offering synergies that support sustainable economic growth and help ensure that the benefits of trade are more widely shared. \r\n\r\nResearch and innovation are also key to building a deeper economic relationship between Canada and Africa. The proposed CA-ECS will strengthen efforts to forge new partnerships between Canadian and African institutions, technologies and businesses to address global challenges of the 21st century such as pandemics, climate change, and inequality. \r\nRelated links\r\n• Gazette Notice of Intent\r\n• A proposed Canada-Africa Economic Cooperation Strategy: background for consultations\r\n• Global Affairs Canada international trade consultations \r\n• Environmental assessments\r\n• Overview: Trade Policy and Gender-based Analysis Plus\r\n• Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development Mandate Letter\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The CFIA evaluates the information in the application to establish that the SIF is safe, effective, and labelled correctly.\r\n\r\nApproved SIFs are currently listed and defined in Schedules IV and V of the Feeds Regulations, with appropriate guarantees, standards, and label requirements. The CFIA will be transitioning to the Canadian Feed Ingredients Table (CFIT) that will be incorporated by reference into the Feeds Regulations, 2023 when they come into effect. In preparation for this new approach, the CFIA is consulting on new or amended SIFs so they can be added to the CFIT, once it comes into effect.

Online audio and video undertakings were able to operate in Canada pursuant to an exemption order. Pursuant to the current Broadcasting Act, online audio and video undertakings can operate in Canada without a licence or pursuant to an exemption.\r\n\r\nIn this public proceeding, the Commission is examining whether there is a need to amend, replace or repeal the current exemption orders for online audio and video undertakings.

Each national urban park will be unique and created through partnerships. Together, these parks will create a network with a shared vision of conserving nature, connecting people with nature, and advancing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. These three elements are the foundation of a new national urban parks policy that is in development. To help gather input on the policy from partners, stakeholders, and the public, Parks Canada has prepared a set of documents called ‘Toward a National Urban Parks Policy’. These documents include a Backgrounder, which provides context, a Discussion Paper that proposes possible requirements and standards that the policy could include for the designation and management of national urban parks, and a set of questions for your input.",

The aim of this initiative is to hold public consultation meetings prior to biannual ICH face-to-face meetings, in order to seek input on certain regulatory aspects that could be beneficial for the harmonisation of ICH guidelines. Stakeholder input received through this initiative will be considered in current or future guideline development. Health Canada also intends to use these opportunities to better understand areas in drug product regulation where Canadian requirements may differ from those in place in the U.S., with a view to minimizing these differences.\r\n\r\nThe next biannual ICH Assembly meeting will take place in Vancouver on June 12th and 13th, 2023. In preparation for this meeting, a public consultation for Canadian and U.S. stakeholders will take place virtually on February 24, 2023 from 1:00 PM EST to 4:00 PM EST. To register for this consultation, please visit the registration page.\r\n\r\nA draft agenda will be available on the registration page. For additional information, including Concept Papers and any available draft guidelines for comment, please visit the ICH Website.\r\n\r\nIn advance of the public meeting, Health Canada and the U.S. FDA are also offering the opportunity for stakeholders to submit comments on these guidelines in writing. Comments will be accepted until Wednesday February 22, 2023.\r\nPlease submit comments to the following email address: ich@hc-sc.gc.ca.",

As a result of this innovation, ISED has seen an unprecedented growth in both the amount and the complexity of consumer products requiring regulatory approval to be introduced to the Canadian marketplace. The fees associated with this program no longer reflect the services or the costs to operate. This consultation is proposing a cost recovery model for its fees which are in line with industry benchmarks.

The Supreme Court of Canada held in R v Mabior that disclosure of HIV status prior to sexual activity was required where there is a realistic possibility of transmission. If there is no realistic possibility of transmission, failure to disclose will not constitute a crime. The Court also noted that a realistic possibility of transmission is negated if (a) viral load is low at the time of sexual relations; and (b) a condom was used. Despite this guidance, the application of the law in this area has been inconsistent. Moreover, there have also been calls to limit the criminal law’s application in this area. The views shared will inform the development of possible criminal law reform in this area.",

NITV is applying for mandatory distribution of Uvagut TV across Canada, whereas Natyf is requesting mandatory distribution of Natyf TV in the province of Quebec only.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the applicants specified that mandatory distribution is vital for the operation of their services, since they are targeting underserved communities.\r\n\r\nCurrently, NITV and Natyf operate the above-noted discretionary services as exempt discretionary services pursuant to the Exemption order respecting discretionary television programming undertakings serving fewer than 200,000 subscribers, set out in the appendix to Exemption order respecting discretionary television programming undertakings serving fewer than 200,000 subscribers, Broadcasting Order CRTC 2015-88, 12 March 2015 (Broadcasting Order 2015-88).",

These sessions are meant to provide information across all sectors (e.g. marine shipping, offshore, pipelines).\r\n\r\nEngagement outcomes will support the development of briefing and communications material to support the legislative process.

Input from the roundtables helped us to:\r\n\r\nbegin to inform this demographic about our organization and its mandate;\r\ngather preliminary feedback from youth on what they see as barriers to accessibility to inform our standards and research priorities; and\r\ngain a better understanding of how best to engage with youth moving forward.\r\n\r\nAbout the event\r\nPartners from across diverse disability communities helped to identify participants for this engagement. One roundtable was in English and the other in French.\r\n\r\nThe participants:\r\n\r\nwere aged 15 to 30;\r\nrepresented the diversity of Canada and Canadian youth living with disabilities; and\r\nrepresented many different regions from across Canada.\r\nThe English session was held on Tuesday, February 22, 2022. The French session was held on Tuesday, March 22, 2022. \r\n\r\nThe virtual event was held on the Zoom platform.\r\nThe Honorable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, delivered an inspirational message. \r\nAccessibility features and accommodations included:\r\n\r\nAmerican Sign Language interpretation;\r\ninterprétation en langue des signes québécoise;\r\ncaptioning;\r\nplain language for all written documents; and\r\nalternative document formats for assistive technologies.\r\nThemes\r\nTo meet its objectives of learning more about the kinds of barriers faced by youth with disabilities, and how to best engage them moving forward, Accessibility Standards Canada prepared four thematic discussion topics. Participants were divided into facilitated discussion groups of 6-8 youth. The four themes were:\r\n\r\nBarriers to Accessibility\r\nBarriers to the Workforce\r\nHow we Engage With Youth\r\nEmerging solutions to barriers",

In addition, discussions were  held with other key stakeholders, such as community leaders, youth justice service providers, lawyers, police officers and researchers.",

It will take full advantage of the new Canadian Correctional Services Survey (CCSS) currently being developed. The CCSS will collect microdata on adults and youth under the responsibility of the federal and provincial/territorial correctional systems and is currently implemented in six provinces. Data include socio-demographic characteristics (e.g. age, Indigenous identity) as well as information pertaining to correctional supervision, including admissions and releases by legal hold status (e.g. remand, sentenced, probation). The strategy is being developed in response to growing interest in and demands for information and disaggregated data in order to better understand the experiences of Indigenous and racialized identity groups in terms of their interactions and involvement with correctional systems and the criminal justice system across the country. In this regard, it also aims to better inform decision-making related to criminal justice and correctional policy as well as program design and delivery.",

        "description": "tatistics Canada, in partnership with the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, is working toward collecting data on the Indigenous and racialized identity of all accused and victims of criminal incidents through its Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey. The UCR Survey collects information on all criminal incidents reported by Canadian police services to monitor the nature and extent of police-reported crime in Canada. Statistics Canada seeks to engage people from diverse perspectives on this initiative including community organizations, academics, police services and other parties of interest at the national, provincial/territorial, municipal, and local government level. This engagement will be used to collect feedback on the value of collecting Indigenous and racialized identity data through the UCR Survey, but also feedback on how should the police report the data, what information should be reported by the police, how the data should be used, and any other related concerns. This initiative is a first step toward gathering data that will help shed light on the experiences of Indigenous and racialized groups as they relate to policing and the criminal justice system more broadly.",

According to a 2009 survey, Canadian households with meters on volume-based water pricing schemes used 73% less water than unmetered households on flat-rate water pricing schemes.\r\nCurrently, under the Weights and Measures Regulations, water meters, are exempt from requiring approval and initial inspection before they are used to determine a customer’s water consumption (unlike scales, gas pumps and other measuring devices used in trade). To help the Government of Canada achieve its climate change goals and sustain our water supply for future generations, Measurement Canada is looking into possible areas where it could assist manufacturers, utilities and end users (e.g. residential home owners) support and promote water conservation through increased accurate measurement of water. \r\nMeasurement Canada is consulting with water meter manufacturers, water distribution utilities and water meter end users to obtain data on current water measurement approaches and water meter billing practices in the Canadian marketplace. Our goal is to ensure that water distribution utilities can use measurement to quickly identify and correct water loss in their systems, and that consumers receive accurate and reliable measurement.",
